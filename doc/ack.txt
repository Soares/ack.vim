INTRODUCTION
*ack*

This plugin is a front for the Perl module App::Ack.  Ack can be used as
a replacement for grep.  This plugin will allow you to run ack from vim, and
shows the results in a split window.

:Ack[!] [options] {pattern} [{directory}]
*:Ack*

	Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
	directory) for the {pattern}. Similar to the |:grep| command but will
	not jump you to the first result unless [!] is given. (This is the
	opposite of :grep's bang.) If existing, g:ack_qhandler will be executed
	afterwards. By default this opens the |Quickfix| window, but you can
	override that behavior.

:AckAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]
*:AckAdd*

	Just like |:Ack|, but instead of making a new list, the matches are
	appended to the current |quickfix| list.

:LAck [options] {pattern} [{directory}]
*:LAck*

	Just like |:Ack| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are placed
	in the current |location-list|. g:ack_lhandler is executed afterwards.

:LAckAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]
*:LAckAdd*

	Just like |:AckAdd| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are
	added to the current |location-list|. g:ack_lhandler is executed
	afterwards.

:AckFile [options] {pattern} [{directory}]
*:AckFile*

	Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
	directory) for filenames matching the {pattern}. Otherwise behaves just
	like |:Ack|.

OPTIONS					*ack-options*

g:ack_program				*ack-program*

	The ack program (and options) to use. |grepprg| will be set to this
	value. Set it to '' to prevent overriding |grepprg|.
	Default: ack -H --nocolor --nogroup --column

g:ack_qhandler				*ack-qhandler*

	A command to run when results have been placed in the quickfix window.
	If you use |CtrlP|, |:CtrlPQuickfix| is recommended.
	Default: |botright| |copen|

g:ack_qhandler				*ack-qhandler*

	A command to run when results have been placed in the location list.
	Default: |botright| |lopen|
